## What is a Container?

A container is a lightweight package that includes:

Application code

Runtime (Java, Python, Node)

Libraries & dependencies

Config files

👉 All bundled together so it runs anywhere consistently


## 🔹 Real Tools

Docker → to create containers

Kubernetes → to manage containers at scale


## 🔬 What Exactly Happens in Containerization?

Think of containerization as 2 major phases:    

👉 1. Build Phase (Create Image)    
👉 2. Run Phase (Start Container)    

🏗️ 1. Build Phase — Creating the Container Image    

This happens when you run:

docker build -t my-app .    
## 🔹 Step 1: Read Dockerfile

Example:
```
FROM openjdk:17
COPY app.jar app.jar
ENTRYPOINT ["java","-jar","app.jar"]
```

👉 Docker reads instructions one by one

## 🔹 Step 2: Create Layers (VERY IMPORTANT 🔥)    

Each line creates a layer:

Base OS layer (Linux)

Java layer

App layer

👉 These layers are:

Cached

Reusable

Immutable

## 🔹 Step 3: Build Image

👉 Final result = Docker Image

Read-only template

Stored locally (or in registry like Docker Hub)

## 🚀 2. Run Phase — Starting the Container

This happens when you run:

docker run my-app
## 🔹 Step 1: Create Container from Image

Add a writable layer on top of image

👉 Image = blueprint
👉 Container = running instance

## 🔹 Step 2: Use Host OS Kernel

👉 Important:

No new OS is created

Container shares host kernel

## 🔹 Step 3: Isolation Using Namespaces

Linux provides namespaces:

PID namespace → separate process IDs

Network namespace → separate IP/ports

File system namespace

👉 Makes container feel like a separate system

## 🔹 Step 4: Resource Control Using cgroups

👉 Control:

CPU usage

Memory usage

Disk I/O

## 🔹 Step 5: Start the Application Process

👉 Finally runs:

java -jar app.jar

👉 This is just a process inside container

## 🔁 Full Flow (Simple)
Code → Dockerfile → Image → Container → Running App





## ⚙️ What Goes Into a Jenkins Groovy (Jenkinsfile) for Microservices?

Think of Jenkins as the orchestrator of your microservices lifecycle:
```
Code → Build → Test → Package → Scan → Deploy → Verify
```


## 🧱 Ideal Pipeline Stages for Microservices    

🔹 1. Checkout Stage (Get Code)
```
stage('Checkout') {
    steps {
        git 'https://github.com/repo.git'
    }
}
```

👉 Pull latest code from Git

🔹 2. Build Stage    
```
stage('Build') {
    steps {
        sh 'mvn clean compile'
    }
}
```

👉 Compile your microservice

🔹 3. Unit Test Stage    
```
stage('Unit Test') {
    steps {
        sh 'mvn test'
    }
}
```
👉 Run unit tests
👉 Fail fast if broken

🔹 4. Code Quality / Static Analysis (Very Important 🔥)    
```
stage('Code Quality') {
    steps {
        sh 'mvn sonar:sonar'
    }
}
```
👉 Use tools like:

SonarQube
👉 Ensures clean code

🔹 5. Package Stage    
```
stage('Package') {
    steps {
        sh 'mvn clean package'
    }
}
```
👉 Creates JAR/WAR    

🔹 6. Build Docker Image (Microservices Core Step)    
```
stage('Docker Build') {
    steps {
        sh 'docker build -t my-service:latest .'
    }
}
```

👉 Containerization happens here

🔹 7. Security Scan (Advanced & Important)    
```
stage('Security Scan') {
    steps {
        sh 'trivy image my-service:latest'
    }
}
```
👉 Scan for vulnerabilities

🔹 8. Push Image to Registry    
```
stage('Push Image') {
    steps {
        sh 'docker push my-service:latest'
    }
}
```

👉 Store image in:

Docker Hub / ECR / GCR

🔹 9. Deploy Stage (Kubernetes)    
```
stage('Deploy') {
    steps {
        sh 'kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml'
    }
}
```

👉 Deploy microservice to cluster

🔹 10. Integration Test / Smoke Test    
```
stage('Smoke Test') {
    steps {
        sh 'curl http://service/health'
    }
}
```

👉 Check if service is running

🔹 11. Notification Stage    
```
post {
    success {
        echo 'Deployment successful'
    }
    failure {
        echo 'Deployment failed'
    }
}
```

## 🧠 Microservices-Specific Considerations    

✅ 1. Independent Pipelines

Each microservice has its own Jenkinsfile

✅ 2. Parallel Execution (Advanced)
stage('Parallel Tests') {
    parallel {
        stage('Unit Test') {
            steps { sh 'mvn test' }
        }
        stage('Integration Test') {
            steps { sh 'mvn verify' }
        }
    }
}
✅ 3. Environment-Based Deployment

Dev → QA → UAT → Prod

✅ 4. Versioning

Tag images:

my-service:v1.0.0
✅ 5. Rollback Strategy

Keep previous versions ready

## 🚫 Common Mistakes

❌ Skipping tests

❌ No security scanning

❌ No rollback strategy

❌ One pipeline for all services

❌ No health checks

## 🎯 Interview Answer (Perfect)

In a microservices architecture, the Jenkins pipeline typically includes stages like code checkout, build, unit testing, static code analysis, packaging, Docker image creation, security scanning, pushing the image to a registry, deployment to Kubernetes, and post-deployment validation like smoke tests. Each microservice has its own independent pipeline, enabling isolated builds and deployments.



## Steps to Automate Deployment in GitLab

1️⃣ Push Code to GitLab

Developers commit and push code to the GitLab repository.

2️⃣ Build the JAR using Maven/Gradle

The GitLab pipeline compiles the Java code and creates a JAR.

3️⃣ Build a Docker Image & Push to Registry

The pipeline creates a Docker image and pushes it to a registry (Docker Hub, AWS ECR, GitLab Container Registry, etc.).

4️⃣ Deploy the Docker Container on a Server

The pipeline pulls the latest image and runs it on a remote server (AWS EC2, On-Premise VM, Kubernetes, etc.).





## How do you do deployment in your company?

Deployment processes vary from company to company, but since you have worked with Spring Boot, Kafka, AWS S3, Kubernetes (K8s), DB2, Perl, and Elasticsearch, your company likely follows a CI/CD pipeline-based deployment for Java microservices.

Could you confirm which specific deployment strategy your company follows? Here are some possible options:

### 1. CI/CD-Based Deployment (Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD, etc.)

Code Commit → Developer pushes changes to Git (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket).

Build & Test → A CI tool like Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI builds the application using Maven/Gradle and runs unit/integration tests.

Artifact Storage → The built JAR/WAR is stored in Nexus, Artifactory, or AWS S3.

Deployment to Kubernetes/Docker

A Docker image is created and pushed to Docker Hub or AWS ECR.

Helm charts or Kubernetes manifests deploy the service to K8s clusters.

Monitoring & Logging → Services like Prometheus, Grafana, Splunk, ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) monitor logs & metrics.


### 2. Blue-Green Deployment (Zero Downtime)

Two environments:
Blue → Running production version.
Green → New deployment.
Traffic is switched to the green environment after successful testing.
Used with AWS ALB, Nginx, Istio, or Kubernetes Ingress Controllers.

### 3. Canary Deployment (Gradual Rollout)

New version is released to a small percentage of users first.
If no issues, traffic is gradually increased.
Achieved using Kubernetes, Istio, Argo Rollouts.

### 4. Manual Deployment (Legacy Systems with DB2 & Perl Jobs)

For DB2, Perl-based scripts:
Files are copied to a staging area (e.g., NFS, HDFS).
Jobs are manually triggered using cron jobs or batch jobs.
Logs are stored in Splunk or Elasticsearch.
Questions for You:
Are you using Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or GitLab CI/CD for deployment?
Are your microservices deployed in Kubernetes (K8s) or on AWS ECS/EC2?
Do you use Docker & Helm for containerization?
Are you implementing blue-green or canary deployments?

## Artifactory in Deployment

Artifactory is a binary artifact repository used for storing and managing build artifacts, such as JARs, WARs, Docker images, and other dependencies. It is commonly used in CI/CD pipelines for deploying Java applications.

## How do you ensure the quality of your code?


##### ✅ 1. In Your IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse)

a. Warnings and Annotations

Deprecated methods are usually highlighted or struck through.

Look for the @Deprecated annotation above the method or class.
```
@Deprecated
public void oldMethod() {
    // ...
}
```
b. Hover or Ctrl+Click

Hover over or Ctrl/Cmd+Click the method to see the Javadoc which often includes:

A warning.

A recommendation for the alternative method.

c. IDE Inspection Tools
In IntelliJ IDEA:
Code > Inspect Code > Whole Project → will list deprecated API usages.

In Eclipse:
Use Problems view and filter for deprecation.

✅ 2. Use Build Tool Warnings

a. Maven
Use mvn clean compile with -X for debug logs. It shows deprecated warnings.

b. Gradle
Run: ./gradlew build --warning-mode all

✅ 3. Static Analysis Tools

SonarQube, Checkstyle, and PMD can detect deprecated API usage.

They help flag usage in reports and CI pipelines.

✅ 4. Dependency Upgrade Awareness

When you upgrade Spring Boot, check the Spring Boot release notes and Spring Framework deprecated list for deprecations.

✅ 5. Using jdeprscan (JDK Tool)

If you're using Java 9+, use the jdeprscan tool:

```
jdeprscan --class-path target/classes --release 17
```
This reports use of deprecated APIs for the given Java release.
